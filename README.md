# Titanic-Project
Using of machine learning algorithms to predict whether the passengers survived or not using titanic dataset

Dataset used - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data \
Metric used - Accuracy\
There are total of 12 Features\
Feature to be predicted - Survived\
Problem Type - Classification

I have used 4 different types of algorithms\
1.Logistic Regression\
2.Random Forest\
3.KNN\
4.SVM\
Out of these 4 algorithms SVM has got highest accuracy of 84%
